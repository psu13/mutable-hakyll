So we're coming close to the end of year *two* of the great dark stupidity. I don't have a
pithy end of year post in me this time. It requires too much energy to generate something
like that, especially given the general weight of narcissistic self-interested bullshit that
hangs so heavily over everything.

As I've said before, I am *personally* fine, but the world overall does not show many
signs of macroscopic improvement. Though I would be negligent if I did now show at least a
bit of appreciation for the few small tastes of real life we had in the summer and early
fall. Concerts even. Those were good.

Here's hoping the tastes get bigger over time.

I'm not optimistic though.
