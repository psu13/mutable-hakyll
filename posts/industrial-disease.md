The other night, we visited one of our favorite local places, the _Grand Canal Cafe_. For
years, they’ve done straightfoward Italian food with a particular emphasis on pastas. Karen had
a craving for their speciality: a ground veal and spinach cannelloni with a tomato and bechamel
sauce.

So we walk in the place, ready for happiness, and they don’t have the cannelloni. They have not
had it for a couple of weeks because of the spinach scare. In an unrelated incident a couple of
weeks ago, we went to the Costco. Two images always stand out when I go to the Costco. The
first is the floor to ceiling bins of electronic entertainment products (PS2, Xbox, Gamecube)
that in some cases people were standing in line to buy on Ebay just a few months ago. For this
particular trip, there were Guitar Hero guitars stacked up as high as the eye could see.

The second image that sticks with me are the industrial sized packages of "specialty foods."

What Costco and this spinach scare have in common is that they bring the nature of our food
distribution system into stark relief. Back in the day, the “organics movement” liked to wrap
itself in a lot of rhetoric about sustainable practices, small volume farming, personal service
and a generally high level of quality (and therefore cost). This was convenient when there was
money to be made and niche luxury markets to grow.

But now organics are Big Business. And I think what we have learned is that Big Business is Big
Business. Horizon and Organic Valley are everywhere. Dannon owns Stonyfield Farm Yogurt. Bags
of organic spinach are everywhere except when they are pulled off the shelf for making people
sick. Five years ago, in Pittsburgh, dozens of people got sick after eating contaminated
vegetables at Chi-Chi’s. Today, it’s organic spinach. Organic food poisoning isn’t any better
than the kind with pesticides

The lesson is, if there is money to be made as a niche luxury, there is even more money to be
made by centralizing distribution, increasing volume, and generally pushing the product into
the largest possible distribution channels. This means the huge restaurant purveyors (Sysco)
and the huge retail outlets (Costco). This, more than anything, is the American Way. There is
nothing that is specialized enough to avoid being turned into a supersized Costco Commodity if
there is enough money to be made.

But, as we learned in _Fast Food Nation_, this kind of distribution is the ideal way for the
bugs to get us. The fact that the organic food industry has fallen to into the same traps as
the fast food industry must be a crushing blow to all of those self-important boomer granola
munchers at the Whole Foods.

I think we can’t have our cake and eat it too. We can’t espouse the ethical high ground of
local food production and local distribution and still want conviently packaged inexpensive
organic spinach year ‘round at the food store. The reality is that smaller scale local food is
more expensive and more limited. So, if you really want to take the high ground, you have to be
willing to pay more and get less. There is no way around that.

Meanwhile, all I want is my god-damned cannelloni. Hopefully it will be back by next month.
