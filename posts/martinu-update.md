A few years ago I complained about this [annoying behavior in the Apple Music search
engine](/the-martinu-bug.html).

I'm happy to say that the hard working people behind that service have made this a lot
better since then. I guess they've added data to the search that make it stay more on
track for this kind of thing.

Who says nothing ever gets better?
