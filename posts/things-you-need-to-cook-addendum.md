Earlier, I made a [short list of everything](stuff-you-need-for-cooking.html) that you
really need to cook. At this time, I need to add one small item. In addition to the stuff
I that I listed earlier, you should head over to the Costco and pick up a “half sheet”
pan. These are shallow aluminium pans that measure about 13"x18" that you can use to bake,
well, almost everything.

Generally, I use them to roast things that I don’t really want to use a roasting pan for.
I have a bad relationship with roasting pans, and like dutch ovens or these shallow pans
instead. They are particularly good for potatoes (toss the potatoes in olive oil, garlic,
herbs, salt and pepper, toss them on the pan and into the oven for 40 minutes). They are
also great for making that one guilty prepared food pleasure that no one should be
without: tater tots.

I think I also used mine to do that oven poached salmon… and it would work equally well
for oven roasted salmon. Basically, if you aren’t roasting it in a pot or a pan, put it on
one of these things and throw it in the oven. Apply the consumer rule and buy six, so you
never run out.
