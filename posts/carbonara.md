This one is so easy it’s almost cheating. This scheme is based on a recipe I have stolen
from Marcella Hazan. Buy [her
book](http://www.amazon.com/Essentials-Classic-Italian-Cooking-Marcella/dp/039458404X/),
it’s in there. But I’ve adjusted the flow a bit to make it easier to follow. For me.

First get out your pasta cooking pot. Fill it with 3-4 quarts of water and bring it to a
boil. Then toss a few big pinches of salt into the water. You don't want _too_ much water
because you want the noodles to be able to make the water starchy while they cook, so you
can use the starchy water later.

Now chop up three or four cloves of garlic and 3 or 4 slices of bacon (or more, go for
it). Put these into a medium sizes saute pan with some oil and cook it until the bacon is
crispy and frying in its own fat for a while. When it's done deglaze the pan with white
wine and reduce for a few minutes.

Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti. This recipe is calibrated to about a pound of pasta, give
or take.

While the pasta cooks, crack three eggs into a bowl and beat them. Add salt and pepper to
taste. This will not take that long, so when you are done grate about a cup or a bit more
of a mix of Romano and Parmesan cheese. The dark secret here is that Romano is better for
this dish.

When the pasta is done take out one scoop of the water. Then drain the rest and dump the
noodles back into the pot. Add the bacon and garlic and all the oil in that pan and mix it
around. Then add the egg and 3/4ths of the cheese and mix it around. If it's too saucy,
add cheese. If it's too dry, add a bit of pasta water. When that is done, garnish with
some fresh green herb if you want, but I never seem to do this anymore. Then add as much
black pepper as you can stand to grind in without your hands cramping up. 

Now you can gorge yourself. 

Oh yeah, if you are nervous about raw eggs, be careful where you buy your eggs. Or you
could always wuss out and get pasteurized eggs.

I love two things about this dish.

1. You never actually have to cook the sauce, per se. You just have to mix it together.

2. It’s really a bacon and eggs breakfast on top of pasta, with cheese. How brilliant is
   that?

Finally, if you are more efficient, you can probably do this with only one pot and the
saute pan. But this flow is a bit easier.
