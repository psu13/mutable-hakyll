This one is so easy it’s almost cheating. But I had to put something here so that we
didn’t lead the front page with the stupid Internet people anymore. So here we go. This
scheme is based on a recipe I have stolen from Marcella Hazan. Buy [her
book](http://www.amazon.com/Essentials-Classic-Italian-Cooking-Marcella/dp/039458404X/),
it’s in there. But I’ve adjusted the flow a bit to make it easier to follow. For me.

First get out a six quart soup pot. Fill it 2/3rds of the way up with water and toss a few
big pinches of salt into the water. You don't want _too_ much water because you want the
water to get starchy when you cook the noodles.

If you have it chop up some fresh parsley. I don’t always have this.

Now chop up three or four cloves of garlic and 3 or 4 slices of bacon. Put these into a
medium sizes saute pan with some oil and cook it until the bacon is crispy and frying in
its own fat for a while. When it's done deglaze the pan with white wine and reduce for a
few minutes.

Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti. This recipe is calibrated to about a pound of pasta, give
or take.

While the pasta cooks, crack three eggs into a bowl and beat them. Add salt and pepper to
taste. This will not take that long, so when you are done grate about a cup or a bit more
of a mix of Romano and Parmesan cheese. The dark secret here is that Romano is better for
this dish.

When the pasta is done take out one scoop of the water. Then drain the rest and dump the
noodles back into the pot. Add the bacon and garlic and all the oil in that pan and mix it
around. Then add the egg and 3/4ths of the cheese and mix it around. If it's too saucy,
add cheese. If it's too dry, add a bit of pasta water. When that is done, toss in the
parsely and mix some more. Then add as much black pepper as you can stand to grind without
your hands cramping up. 

Now you can gorge yourself. 

Oh yeah, if you are nervous about raw eggs, be careful where you buy your eggs. Or you
could always wuss out and get pasteurized eggs.

I love two things about this dish.

1. You never actually have to cook the sauce, per se. You just have to mix it together.

2. It’s really a bacon and eggs breakfast on top of pasta, with cheese. How brilliant is
   that?

Finally, if you are more efficient, you can probably do this with only one pot and the
saute pan. But this flow is a bit easier.
