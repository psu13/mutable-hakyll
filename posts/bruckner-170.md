A couple of years ago the PSO [promised me that they would
play](./two-thirds.html) the Bruckner Symphony Number 8 in
concert, and then ended up changing their minds and playing the Beethoven 9 instead.

This year they made it up to me by again putting the Bruckner into the season as both a
live performance and a recording session. As soon as I found out I bought both my normal
subscription ticket _and_ a second ticket for the Sunday show to sit up in Family Circle
and get the whole thing again from a much better vantage point with much better sound.

The Bruckner and Mahler symphonies are the "apex predators", if you will, of the late
romantic symphony orchestra repertoire. They are long, huge, extended, long, epic, and
long works. People just don't write this sort of thing anymore, a fact emphasized by the
companion piece in the concert. Samy Moussa's Adgilis Deda: Hymn for orchestra, which he
wrote for the PSO in 2024, is an _excellent_ piece and fits very well with Bruckner's
style, actually. But it's entire length is not even quite as long as the shortest movement
in the 8th symphony.

The Bruckner 8 runs about 85 minutes in four movements (about 18, 15, 27, and 25 minutes,
respectively). The movements go: not too fast, medium fast, really slow (Adagio), and
finale: not that slow, but not too fast. I don't have the background or vocabulary to
describe to you how the piece works. I've read a lot of nonsense (my words) about how the
piece is about life and death and afterlife. Maybe. I just like the tunes. I think I did notice
that the Finale is sonata form this time, which I had not before. That was fun.

But what I do in the all of the big Bruckner pieces is to just sit there and revel in the
glory of flow and buildup to the giant brass chorales, marveling at how the orchestra just
sounds great whether they are playing slow or fast(er), so loud that the walls shake or so
soft that you can barely hear them over the hum of the AC. The peak moment in the famous
Adagio in this piece in particular is a top "beat drop" in classical music, complete with
giant cymbal crashes.

Both shows lived up to my very high expectations. Best music shows of the year so far. 170
minutes of Bruckner bliss. Sunday was probably slightly better then Friday. It felt
tighter and more assured. Family Circle is the best musical sound that you can experience
in Pittsburgh, especially when the PSO is going full blast through a huge piece. You
should do it some time.

In the second show I sat next to an enterprising CMU music student who had _also_ bought
tickets to two shows. He thought he was the only one insane enough to do this. The kids
are alright.

Meanwhile, over that the Post Gazette (RIP) the current music writer Jeremy Reynolds
wondered a bit out loud how to make sense of playing a piece like this in our current time
and place. After all, much of the audience (including, perhaps, Jeremy) will have a hard
time sitting through, much less actually appreciating. I think he would prefer to hear the
more compact and efficient (my words) Brahms style work, rather than Bruckner's
overwrought nonsense. I think this is a fair take. But it would also be sad if we lost
live performances of the bigger pieces. The reason is that as I have said in the past,
recordings give you the 25% of the piece that sits on the surface of the sound. You never
_really_ hear a piece unless it's performed live though. So I hope people keep doing it.

Jeremy also brought up the idea of the dreaded "talk to the audience about the show before
the show" idea, so that people might have a map of what is about to happen to them as they
sat down at the start of the 85 minute marathon. I am long on record as hating this idea.
I don't think a ten minute talk before the concert is going to be enough to guide the
Bruckner novice to the end of the 80 minute tunnel. The only way to do this is to practice
and train, if you will.

Luckily these days this is really easy. Fire up Spotify, Apple Music, Presto, or Youtube
and there will be _dozens_ of available recordings of this piece for you to study. The
idea is to listen to it through a few times so that you at least know the bigger structure
of the piece before you are in the dark with just your thoughts and the band. For things
like the Bruckner this is _an absolute must_.  Listen in short segments at first, and then
whole movements, and then finally a couple of complete end to end run throughs. You can do
this in a week instead of (or in addition to) scrolling short videos on social media. Then
on concert you'll now what's coming, and what favorite moments to anticipate and look
forward to. This is great fun.

While I'm sure there are musical savants who can plop themselves down in front of an 80
minute piece cold and just love it—for the regular human I'm not really sure there is any
other way to approach this problem than to do this work. Certainly a ten minute talk
before show is not going to fill in these gaps. If nothing else playing the piece ahead of
time will tell you whether you, like Jeremy, would rather listen to Brahms and Dvorak and
thus save your money. This is fine. Not everything is for everyone. I happen to love both,
but probably Bruckner more just because he is really so different from everything else you
can hear these days.

But... I do have another somewhat unhinged idea that I'm sure no orchestra will ever try, but
someone should do it.

Back in the 90s there was a great show on the MTV spinoff network VH1 called "Pop-up
Video". What the show did was play music videos, but overlay them with pithy little bits
of meta-commentary.

Here is a modest example ...example...
