One of my earliest Classical Music memories was my dad sitting down with me one evening
and making the bold claim that there was Classical Music that was not overly long,
pretentious and tedious. That is, there were numbers that immediately grabbed you by the
throat and made you pay attention until they were over. My seven or eight year old face
probably registered some amount of skepticism about this claim.

In response he sauntered over to the record cabinet and pulled down a big black disk and
stuck it on the turntable and maybe the most famous four note beat drop in the history of
music came pouring out of the speakers. You know the one:

> Dan dan dan daaaaan.

I'm pretty sure it was this one:

Anyway he was right. The music grabbed me and made me pay attention.

In my adult life I never saw any reason to have any boxes of Beethoven symphonies
except that one cycle from the 1960s conducted by von Karajan. Toss in the 5th and the 7th
by Kleiber, like everyone tells you to, and what else do you need? Nothing. I've also
spent a lot of time bemoaning the preponderance of Beethoven in concert programs. Just
once, so my standard rant goes, why not play something else?

Well, there are a lot of reasons, not the least of which is that as much as you'd like to
hear something different once in a while, the man did write banger after banger.
