One of my earliest Classical Music memories was my dad sitting down with me one evening
and making the bold claim that there was Classical Music that was not overly long,
pretentious and tedious. That is, there were numbers that immediately grabbed you by the
throat and made you pay attention until they were over. My seven or eight year old face
probably registered some amount of skepticism about this claim.

In response he sauntered over to the record cabinet and pulled down a big black disk and
stuck it on the turntable and maybe the most famous four note beat drop in the history of
music came pouring out of the speakers. You know the one:

> Dan dan dan daaaaan.

I'm pretty sure it was this one, with von Karajan conducting in 1962 or 1963:

Anyway he was right. The music grabbed me and made me pay attention.

In my adult life I never saw any reason to have any boxes of Beethoven symphonies except
that one cycle from the 1960s. Toss in the 5th and the 7th by Kleiber, like everyone tells
you to, and what else do you need? Nothing. I've also spent a lot of time bemoaning the
preponderance of Beethoven in concert programs. Just once, so my standard rant goes, why
not play something else?

Well, there are a lot of reasons, not the least of which is that as much as you'd like to
hear something different once in a while, the man did write banger after banger.

So late in life, meaning in the last few months, while getting ready to hear the Beethoven
7 at local show I decided to finally peruse an "overview" of the available recordings.
Happily such surveys are a staple of Classical Music magazines, web sites, and now youtube
channels so there was plenty of material around to guide me. Here is the pile of boxes
that I dug up including that most famous one from 1963.

**Karajan 1962**

**Karajan 1977 **

**Bernstein on DG, 1977-1979**

**Blomstedt 2017**

**Blomstedt 1980**

**Gunter Wand 1987**

**Honeck, PSO**
