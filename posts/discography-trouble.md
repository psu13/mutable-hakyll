Today an interesting story (to me anyway) about how recorded music can go all wrong.

One of my early CD purchases was a reissue of a classic Louis Armstrong album called
_Satch Plays Fats_. It was part of a series that Columbia put out in the 80s that all had
goofy purple and blue cover art. Like this:

Anyway. This has always been one of my favorite albums.

Recently I was going through my iTunes files and wanted to clean up my rip of this album
to be at a lossless bit-rate, even though I can't really hear the difference. It makes me
feel good.

So I bought a download from there:

But, a strange thing happened when I loaded up the files and played them. The album was
_completely_ different from what I remember.

So now I had to figure out why.

Here is why:

In the 1950s Louis Armstrong recorded two compilation albums for Columbia dedicated to single songwriters

1. Louis Armstrong Plays W.C. Handy
2. Satch Plays Fats

In the 1980s each of these was reissued on CD in a series that Columbia (was it Sony yet? I
don't think so) put out early in the CD era with the aforementioned blue and purple
covers. You can see them here:

[https://www.discogs.com/sell/release/2786247](https://www.discogs.com/sell/release/2786247)

and

[https://www.discogs.com/release/4232232](https://www.discogs.com/release/4232232-Louis-Armstrong-And-His-All-Stars-Satch-Plays-Fats)

Then, in the year 2000, Columbia (now definitely Sony) reissued these albums again in a new
series with cover art that was more like the original LPs. Like this:

[https://www.discogs.com/release/9183701](https://www.discogs.com/release/9183701-Louis-Armstrong-And-His-All-Stars-Satch-Plays-Fats-A-Tribute-To-The-Immortal-Fats-Waller-By-Louis-Ar)

But as I found out, if you pick up this CD and listen to it, it's very different from the
other one.

What happened was that for the Columbia 40378 reissue they could not find the master tapes,
and so they cobbled together a weird set of edited alternates and threw that out there
instead to make the cash. Then later they found the masters and redid the whole thing.

The first W.C. Handy reissue is also different from more recent reissues. Although I'm not
sure if the situation is quite as dire as for poor Fats Waller. I have never owned that CD
so I can't compare (to discogs!)

As always, the Internet has all the details.

The following excerpt from the Jos Willems discography comes from this [forum
post](https://www.organissimo.org/forum/topic/79781-satch-plays-fats-alternates/), which
you probably can't read without getting an account at that web site.

So here is what it says (reformatted by psu):

From the Jos Willems discography:

**Satch Plays Fats, 1986 columbia 40378**

1.    Honeysuckle Rose: 2:58,  _Partially Alternate Take_
2.    Blue Turning Grey Over You: 4:44, _Alternate Take_
3.    I'm Crazy 'Bout My Baby: 4:28,  _Partially Alternate Take_
4.    Squeeze Me: 5:04, _No Overdub_
5.    Keepin' Out Of Mischief Now: 3:20,  _Partially Alternate Take_
6.    All That Meat And No Potatoes: 5:15, _Master_
7.    I've Got A Feeling I'm Falling: 3:13, _No Overdub_
8.    Black And Blue: 4:39, _Master_
9.    Ain't Misbehavin': 4:37,  _Alternate Take_

**Plays W.C. Handy, 1986 columbia 40242**

1.    St. Louis Blues:    8:54,  _Partially Alternate Take_
2.    Yellow Dog Blues:   4:15, _Master_
3.    Loveless Love:    4:32,  _Partially Alternate Take_
4.    Aunt Hagar's Blues:    4:57,  _Alternate Take_
5.    Louis Armstrong Monologue: 0:46
6.    Long Gone:   4:14,  _Partially Alternate Take_
7.    The Memphis Blues: 3:00, _Master_
8.    Beale Street Blues:   4:58,  _Alternate Take_
9.    Ole Miss:    4:39,  _Alternate Take_
10.   Chantez-Les Bas: (Sing 'Em Low):   4:48  _Alternate Take (unspliced)_
11.   Hesitating Blues:    5:20,  _Partially Alternate Take_
12.   Atlanta Blues:    4:33, _No Overdub_

The interesting thing is that the alternate material on these two CDs has _never_ been
reissued again. The later CD reissues just try to forget that it exists.

Also, even the recent Mosaic Records Box that covers this period does not include these
tracks. And Mosaic generally tries to get _everything_.

Anyway. I picked up a used copy of the W.C. Handy disk just to see what it's like. I'll
add a notation on this page when I receive it and find out.
