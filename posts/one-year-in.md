One year ago today was my "official" start of work (and everything else) from home and the current great darkness (although I had personally started a day or two before).

I have nothing else to say about this, but am just marking the time since time otherwise has no real meaning. Hopefully we'll be able to avoid the gravitational pull of the morons long enough to get out of this in less than another year.

Oh, RIP Chaya in Squirrel Hill. Up to the end it was the only place in town where the sushi rice was almost right. Now there is no place that I know of that gets this right.

OK. That's it.
