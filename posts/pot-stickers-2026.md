Yes I know jiaozi are not pot stickers, but I'm stuck with the title I picked ... too many
years ago, so we're mixing the names here.

We recently had the opportunity to make the famous dumplings (_jiaozi_) with my mom in the
room and learned yet another small set of details to integrate into the recipe. So, with
this in mind I decided to redo this page yet again to add the new material.

We make this dish in five stages.

#### Dough, Stage 1

1. Start with 2-3 cups of flour and one cup of _cold_ water. Or, if you want to be more
accurate, in our experience the final ratio of flour to water _by weight_ tends to settle
at between 1.9 to 2 (really around 1.95). So (say) 400 grams of flour to 200 grams of
water. These things will vary a lot based on the flour you use, your humidity, etc. So
take these as starting points.

2. Put most of the flour in a bowl. Add most of the water but not all and stir it around with chopsticks.

3. If the flour does not soak up all the water, add flour. If it is too dry, add water.
   Stir some more, check again. Turn the mixture out on to a board and knead it until it
   holds together. Don't worry about making the ball smooth.

4. Because of the inevitable variance in how the dough comes out it's a good idea to make
   an extra dough ball or two for each batch. Then you can pick the ones you like later.

It's tricky to know when the dough is right, and getting it consistently right takes a lot
of practice. We've been doing it for decades now and still get a lot of variance. What you
are after is a dough that is pretty stiff, but soft enough to still be workable. It should
take some work to poke it with your finger, but it should eventually bounce back. And,
there should be enough moisture in the dough to hold it together. The rest time in the
fridge will relax the dough and even out the wet, making the dough softer when you finally
work with it.

5. Put the ball into a ziploc bag and stick it in the fridge for a few hours.

6. Pull the ball out of the fridge. The dough should be stiff but flexible. Knead it around a bit, adding flour if it is sticky. Put it back in the fridge for a few more hours.

Make two balls to use up the filling recipe below.

#### Filling, Stage 1

Start with about a pound of ground pork. You don't want the pork to be too finely ground,
and you want some fat in it but not too much. The best place to get the right pork for
this is at the meat counter of your Asian grocery if you have one. If not do the best you
can.

Next collect the following:

- One bunch of scallions, give or take. Try to find nice small ones.

- A good sized knob of ginger that you've peeled. An inch or two long by a half an inch
  wide is nice.

- A good sized nappa cabbage.

- Soy sauce, a dash of sesame oil, salt, pepper.

Chop up one bunch of scallions, mostly the tops. You do this by first slicing them the long way, then collecting up the pieces and chopping them the short way. You want it to be about this size

Now chop up some ginger the same way. Make about a half a cup of it. You won't use all of it, but it's good to have extra just in case. You want the ginger to be about the same size:

Finally, do the same for a head of Napa cabbage. You can use a food processor to finish to job if you want.

Salt the cabbage and let it sit so some juice starts coming out it. You can squeeze the
juice out with your hands into a bowl (if you are a badass) or you can twist it in cheese
cloth to get a similar effect. You don't get as much juice with the cloth. You want the
cabbage to be as dry as you can make it. Save the juice in a bowl.

Now collect all your ingredients together:

Put the pork and a bowl. Add a pinch of salt and some ground pepper. Then add about a
tablespoon of soy sauce, and the dash of sesame oil. Mix the soy into the meat using two
chopsticks or something similar. A bigger mixing spoon won't really work. I used to do
this with a fork but later decided that this would cut the meat up too much. So I switched
to chopsticks even though I'm not that good at it.

Mix the meat _only_ clockwise or _only_ counterclockwise. I did this once and it worked
great so I'm sticking with it.

Once the soy sauce is incorporated add some of the cabbage juice. Not the cabbage, just
the water. Mix that in the same away as the soy sauce. Keep adding juice until the meat
gets to be a pasty texture. Usually a few tablespoons is enough. If in doubt add less
until you get the hang of it.

Mix this together along with a couple of handfuls of the scallion
and as much ginger as you can stand. At this point the filling should look something like
this, but a bit more broken down. I took this picture too soon.

I usually use the smell and look of the meat mixture to figure out how to adjust the ingredients. After the initial pass I usually add a bit more soy and some more scallion.

Now set this side and start to get the dough ready for filling.

#### Dough, Stage 2

Get the dough out of the fridge about an hour before you start to work in earnest. Cut the
ball into three pieces and roll each out into a long string about 1/2 to 3/4ths of an inch
in diameter. Put the long pieces of dough under a damp cloth, and then take one of them
out and cut 1/2 inch long pieces off of it with a knife or dough blade until you run out.
The classic technique for doing this is to pull the pieces off the string with your hands.
That's pretty fun but cutting the dough works just as well.

Recent experimentation indicates that if you start with a piece of dough that weighs about
14 or 15 grams you get a nice sized dumpling. 12 grams is a bit too small, 18-20 is a bit
too big. We tend to make jiaozi that take two bites to eat. If you want to make single
bite dumplings you want smaller pieces of dough.

Now squish the dough nuggets into small rounds with the heel of your hand, so they look
like this:

> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79904144@N00/3609320910/" title="P1010807 by psu13, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3360/3609320910_164e8cb41b_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="P1010807" /></a>

Each round should be around about an 1.5 or 2 inches across. Do one "rope" at
a time. About the time the first rope is done, finish making the
filling.

#### Filling, Stage 2

The last part of making the filling is adding the cabbage. You want to add the cabbage
last and then assemble immediately. The reason you want to do this is if you add the
cabbage too soon and then let the meat sit, more water will leech out of the vegetables
and into the meat and make the filling fall apart later. Sad.

So, for one pound of pork add about 2 to 3 cups (or even more) of the chopped cabbage from
before depending on how much you like. You can get a lot more in that seems possible, and
generally the more the better. The cabbage adds a nice crunch and juiciness to the final
product that you want. The filling in a jiaozi should not be a dense meatball.

Anyway, when you are done the meat should look like this:

> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79904144@N00/3608505569/" title="P1010805 by psu13, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3363/3608505569_d6ebd90d80_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="P1010805" /></a>

This is an old picture which is why it has a fork in it. Mix with chopsticks. 🙂   

Now you are ready for assembly.

#### Stage 5, Assembly

First, you have to roll the skin out. Take one of the little rounds you had before and a
small rolling pin. The best kind of rolling pin is made by cutting a broomstick-sized
dowel into a pin about 6 inches long.

Get a lot of flour on the dough, the pin, the board, and your hands. Roll the dough from
the edge into the middle. Then turn it 30 degrees, then roll it again, then turn,
repeating until you've spun it round once or twice. You want to roll it about as
thin as those frozen wonton skins. Those are a good reference, so buy some, but don't use
them for jiaozi, or I'll have to beat you. They suck.

The goal is to have the middle of the skin be a bit thicker than the sides, so it can
support the filling. Like this:

> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79904144@N00/3611965069/" title="DSC_3887001 by psu13, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3562/3611965069_f8393a3381_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="DSC_3887001" /></a>

Perfect roundness and uniformity of size is not important. The guy filling the skin can
fix that in post.

Assuming you are right handed, here is how you fold the dumplings: take one of the rolled
out skins and hold it in the palm of your left hand face up. Put a small amount of filling
in the middle. Now with your right hand, pick up the skin in the "middle" and
fold it over the filling and pinch it together on the other side. Then turn the thing over
to the left, pinch the left ends together, and work your way back to the middle. Then do
the same thing from the right end. When you start at this, you usually end up with
something that looks like a ravioli. But, with practice, you'll get stuff that looks more
like a pot sticker and can "stand up."

When my mom makes these, she can supply three or four fillers with enough skins to keep
busy. You will be slower (until about 40 years from now). So balance the number of rollers
and fillers according to the talent you have. At our get togethers I can usually fold fast
enough to keep up with 3 or 4 of the "guests" who we have enslaved into doing rolling
duty.

When you get one filled and folded, it should look like this:

Or, if my mom has made you a perfectly sized skin:

> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79904144@N00/3608505009/" title="psu_20080101-00071 by psu13, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3328/3608505009_6b8e06ddcf_m.jpg" width="240" height="192" alt="psu_20080101-00071" /></a>

Take the filled dumplings and put them on a tray. I like to use sheet pans with floured
wax paper. Don't let them sit around too long before cooking. An hour or two at most.
Anything you don't cook should be frozen on the trays, then put into freezer bags.

#### Cooking

To make the boiled dumplings, fill a large pot with water. Bring to a boil. Drop the
dumplings in one by one. Cook until they float, then a couple of minutes past or until you
are sure the pork is cooked through. 

One thing people do here is to add the dumplings, and then when the water comes back to a
boil you add cold water to cut the boil off. Then wait for the next boil and do the same
thing, repeating this cycle a few times until the jiaozi are done. The idea behind this
technique is two things:

1. Keep the water from boiling too hard and breaking your skins.

2. Allow some extra time for the filling to cook without overcooking the skins.

I'll do this if I think of it but it's not critical.

Pot stickers are trickier, but more fun, to make. Get a non-stick frying pan on medium heat. Add some oil and lay out the dumplings like this:

> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79904144@N00/3609320336/" title="psu_20080101-00074 by psu13, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3337/3609320336_581304b686_m.jpg" width="161" height="240" alt="psu_20080101-00074" /></a>

Mix 1/4 cup water with 2 dashes of vinegar and pour it into the pan. You want enough liquid to steam the tops of the dumplings for a bit, but not so much that they cook in it. If the liquid doesn't dry out, you won't get crunchy bottoms.

Cover and cook about 10 minutes. With practice you'll figure out how long to cook them to
get the nice burnt bottom that gives the dish its name.

If you get really good you can turn them out on to the serving platter in one piece:

People love that sort of flourish.

Pot stickers are great fun, but the truth is that the boiled ones are better. You get the
soft chewy "pasta" followed the meaty filling followed by the crunch of the
vegetables followed by the yummy cooking juices. There's nothing like it.

Serve these with soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil and hot sauce. Your guests can mix these however they want for dipping. Or you can eat the things plain.
