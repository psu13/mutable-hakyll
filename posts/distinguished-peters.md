*Note*: This is a post from the old [tleaves
site](http://www.tleaves.com/weblog/archives/000642.html) written by both me and my old buddy
Pete (*peterb*). I have copied the post here to clean up the formatting a bit. I made one
other small change to address reader complaints. People complained at the time that the
order of *psu* and *peterb* changed around apparently at random. So in this version I made
it consistent except for the very last one, which only works in that order.

Recently we have become aware that some readers of the blog have difficulty telling the
two Petes, *psu* and *peterb*, apart. Here’s a handy reference guide for when you have
trouble. 

*psu*: Wannabe French poseur. <br>

*psu*: Subscribes to NetFlix, but never watches any of the movies. <br>
*peterb*: Can’t subscribe to NetFlix because he’s too cheap.
