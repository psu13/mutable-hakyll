I can't believe that I actually have to say this for a _third fucking time_ but in its
infinite wisdom our never ending election cycle, whose apologists claim _must be this long
and torturous_ so as to be properly reflective, has _again_ pooped out the Orange Dipshit
as the candidate for the GOP.

Please do your part to make sure he goes home again. Maybe for good this time, though the
odds seem against it. [We have to be done with this
