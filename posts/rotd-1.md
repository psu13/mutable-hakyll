I started posting links to records that I listen to on social media. I've done this
before, but then never kept track of what I already posted or didn't. So now I'm going to
use this site to do that in batches. Here are 1-100, in reverse order since this is a blog
and so everything is always reverse order.

Miles Davis: Round about Midnight. One of the first records with the classic Coltrane group.
