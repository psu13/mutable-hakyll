Today a recipe to take your mind off the idiotic state of the world.

One of my Instant Pot staples is this chili verde recipe from Kenji at serious eats:

What I have found over time is that every time I make it I always have around twice as
many tomatillos as the recipe calls for, but it's fine if I just toss them in anyway. Then
what I end up with is a few servings of the pork with sauce and also about a pint or two
of the sauce leftover.

The sauce is a great thing to use for various things when you remember you have it. You
can put it on other meat and then on rice or tortillas. You can use it to make your own
chilaquiles at home. It would be great on top of fried rice. You can put it in a bowl and
eat it with a spoon. 

Pretty soon I realized that the _sauce_ we actually better than the rest of the chili.

So then I started making the chili verde recipe but with just a small amount of pork for
the fat and the extra flavor. Then you get about a quart of sauce to use for sauce things.

This turns out to be the best thing ever. So for reference, here is what goes in:

1. As many tomatillos has you have. One quart or two from the farmer's market is the
   standard unit.
1. One onion.
1. A few big cloves of garlic.
1. A tablespoon of whole cumin seeds, with a pinch of coriander seeds thrown in. If you
   want to be cool toast them and crush them in a mortar and pestle. If you are lazy like
   me just toss them in the pot.
1. Whatever chilis you can find. I have trouble finding good hot ones that aren't too hot.
   I think I'm going to start trying to use those thai chilis.
1. If you like cilantro add lots of cilantro. Then add some more.
1. Celery/celery leaves if you have good ones.
1. Salt and pepper.
1. 1/2 cup or so of stock or water.
1. Fish sauce and/or MSG if you want to be extra East Asian.
1. 8oz of fatty pork. Fresh belly is the best. Cut this into large pieces so you can fish
   them out later.

Put all this in the Instant pot and set it for high pressure for 30min.

When the cooker is done fish all the meat out and blend everything else into sauce.

Adjust salt and pepper until it's right.

Now put this on everything and enjoy life.
