A friend of mine who went to graduate school in Pittsburgh before moving back to Singapore
once gave me a valuable piece of advice that every food tourist should take to heart. The
"Rajesh Menu Rule" is that if you are in a place and you see an item on the menu that
you've never seen before in a place of that kind, you should order it immediately. The
context for his application of this rule was Indian restaurants in the U.S. many of which
have a fairly standard menu template. Any deviation from this standard usually indicates
some true piece of creativity that the owners of the place want to point out, so it's good
to investigate.

On my first trip to [Vancouver, BC](vancouver-bc-cooler-than-seattle.html) in 2010 I sadly
did not follow this advice when getting dinner at [Kintaro
Ramen](https://www.yelp.ca/biz/kintaro-ramen-vancouver), a small ramen shop that sits in a
cluster of them in the western part of the downtown area. On that trip I spied the item
they have on their menu that you probably won't see in most other shops: "Cheese Ramen".
They even call it out as a special thing that is of their original creation. I should have
have ordered it on sight, but at the time I wanted the more straight up version of the
dish, since Pittsburgh is something of a ramen wasteland. That's fine.

What is inexplicable is that I could have gone _back_  to this shop in 2014 and _again_
neglected to try it. I had always felt low level regret about this and had always hoped to
get back to Vancouver honor Rajesh by correctly following his advice at this place.

So this year when we decided to go back to Vancouver for an end of up-and-down year trip,
to hopefully end the up-and-down year on an up note, my mission was clear. On our fourth
night in town (there is a lot of food in this town, it took until then for a spot to clear
up in our schedule, and even then we were still semi-stuffed with dim sum lunch) we headed
back to the shop and I got my bowl. And it was good.

The bowl is based on their miso broth with slices of pork and then one shredded cheese
(maybe mild swiss, maybe mozzarella) and one slice of cheese (probably mozzarella):

As you eat it the cheese melts into the soup and all over the noddles. It's nice! You can
kind of see the cheese melted into the noodles and broth here:

At this point I could make the rest of this post a lightly annotated list of about 125
food pictures. But that would be pretty tedious. So I'll try and edit this down to the top
ten or fifteen highlights along with where the dishes came from.

Our main sources for food info came from a list that a colleague that the Apple office in
the city gave me that leaned heavily on the Japanese spots around Downtown, and also the food
blog [Sherman's Food Adventures](http://www.shermansfoodadventures.com) that I found out
about from a friend of my brother's who lives in town and plays hockey with Sherman.
Sherman apparently produces that web site as a "hobby", which gives you an idea of what
hobby-level eating is like in Vancouver, BC (remember: [it's cooler than
Seattle](https://mutable-states.com/vancouver-bc-cooler-than-seattle.html)).
