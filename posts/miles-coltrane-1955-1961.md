Miles Davis and John Coltrane played and recorded in the same group roughly between the
years of 1955 and 1961. There were the legendary sessions for Prestige that resulted in
the four "verbin'" albums (_Steamin'_, _Workin'_, _Relaxin'_, _Cookin'_) and the equally
legedary period at Columbia that resulted in _Round About Midnight_, _Milestones_, _Kind
of Blue_, and _Someday my Prince Will Come_.

Here is a maybe complete list of sessions that I grabbed off the Internet. I also threw in
a few of the more famous live dates that this group played, because those show up in the
rest of my story. The source for this list is an excellent online discography that you can
find here:

What you realize when you look study this list is that the albums I listed above are a
tiny part of the full story. This is especially true for the Columbia stuff, which I will
now discuss in more detail.

The original releases of the Columbia albums left a huge amount of material unreleased.
Some of this material appeared on reissues produced in the 60s, 70s, but it's a bit of a
hodge podge. 

Then the early CD reissues covered Columbia in shame in a variety of
ways. There were the weird blue/purple sleeves, messed up sound, missing master tapes,
and even incorrect cover art (like this in retrospect awful cover for [Kind of
Blue](https://www.discogs.com/release/400039-Miles-Davis-Kind-Of-Blue)).

The initial reissues of the four albums above mostly just stuck to the original material.
But there were a few new albums like [Miles &
Coltrane](https://www.discogs.com/master/65072-Miles-Davis-And-John-Coltrane-Miles-Coltrane),
or ['58 Miles Featuring Stella By Starlight](https://www.discogs.com/release/495913-Miles-Davis-Featuring-John-Coltrane-Cannonball-Adderley-Bill-Evans-58-Miles-Featuring-Stella-By-Star)
that randomly combined live material from different sessions, or live material with
alternate studio takes.

Later reissues of _Round About Midnight_, _Milestones_, _Kind of Blue_ fixed most of the
production issues (better sound, correct cover art, et) and added some of the unreleased
tracks back, but again in fairly random and haphazard manner. This especially true in the
case of the latest extra-deluxe "Legacy" reissues of _Round About Midnight_ and _Kind of
Blue_ both of which just toss on an extra disk of material from completely unrelated
sessions for no reason at all except frustrate nerds like me who want things to make
sense.

At this point, the frustrated not-quite completist usually turns to the Mosaic-style boxed
set to make sure that they all the takes grouped together in a way that is coherent. But
somehow with these recordings even this route fails.

For a long time I owned [Miles Davis & John Coltrane – The Complete Columbia Recordings
1955-1961](https://www.discogs.com/master/160343-Miles-Davis-John-Coltrane-The-Complete-Columbia-Recordings-1955-1961),
the boxed set that Mosaic put together for Columbia in return for the right to release the
same material on fancy LPs. This should have been the package that did everything _right_.
All of the tracks from every session in a reasonably chronological order with a nice book
describing all the history. Unfortunately I irrationally dislike this set in every way.
The main reason is that the tracks are never presented in anything like the original album
order. Instead all the alternates are back to back with the masters, but I never want to
listen to the same piece three times before moving to the next one. Later boxed sets would
move away from this strict chronological session ordering and sometimes provide an "album
then alternates" kind of arragement that is a lot easier to deal with. But not here.

Luckily these days we have the tools to collect together something like this for
ourselves. Thanks to decades of different reissues, good discographical databases like the
web site above, and most of all thanks to [discogs.com](https://www.discogs.com) where you
can usually find just the right version of every CD or LP ever released, putting together
just the right set of reissues is not intractable.

So that's what I did. My list of things fell this way:

- The 2001 one disk Legacy reissue of [Round about
  Midnight](https://www.discogs.com/release/435163-Miles-Davis-Round-About-Midnight). This
  has a few alternates from the same session as a bonus.
- The 2001 one disk Legacy reissue of
  [Milestones](https://www.discogs.com/release/3804866-Miles-Davis-Milestones). But I also
  got the 1988 purple/blue cover one, because it was interesting.
- One of the later reissues (1997, I think) of [Kind of
  Blue](https://www.prestomusic.com/jazz/products/8269533--kind-of-blue) as a download and
  on vinyl. The CD I have has an alternate take for _Flamenco Sketches_. But the download
  I have does not and I never miss it. You won't either.
- I don't actually own [Some Day My Prince Will Come](https://www.discogs.com/release/7154240-Miles-Davis-Sextet-Someday-My-Prince-Will-Come) because I'm a bad person. But I'll
  get the same 2001-ish Legacy CD or download probably.
- I downloaded a Japanese compilation called [1958
  Miles](https://www.prestomusic.com/jazz/products/8253233--1958-miles) because it has
  some of the unreleased studio material from this period.
- Also from 1958 is the live set from Newport. That's collected in the [At Newport
  1958](https://www.discogs.com/master/543503-Miles-Davis-At-Newport-1958) album 
  from 2001. You can get this as a download too.
- The live stuff from Europe in 1960 has long been available in various ways, but now Sony
  actually released it for real on CD so you might as well get that. It's in a series of
  releases called [Miles Davis & John Coltrane – The Final
  Tour](https://www.discogs.com/master/1336254-Miles-Davis-John-Coltrane-The-Final-Tour-The-Bootleg-Series-Vol-6).
- There is another live set from the Plaza hotel that I just found out about that is
  historically interesting, but the recorded sound is awful. So I did not bother.

OK that's it. Oh but of course there are any number of new vinyl productions if you have
that particular fetish. And don't forget the mono mixes.
