I posted an idea on twitter a while back that I wanted to keep in the Intertubes, which is
one of the reasons that I don't delete my old twitter account. Then I realized I could
post it here instead of tediously moving it to every new "social" platform every time the
current one burns down.

This is the idea:

> Idea: Slow Code ... a non-profit dedicated to the idea of improving the software world
> by taking more time to write less code.

Here is a screen shot of it to prove the time stamp:

As a useless digression, another idea that I posted on twitter first was about [the
fog](./to-the-fog.html). So here is a screen shot of that to prove the timestamp:

> <a href="images/the-fog.png"><img src="images/the-fog.png" width=400></a>

Pretty soon I'll be able to delete the twitter after I carefully move all the screen shots
here. 

Anyway, the idea in _slow code_ is, of course, stolen from the idea behind _Slow Food_.
The main purpose of Slow Food is, to a first approximation, to apply this same idea to
food. That is, a way to treat food that in a way that pays due respect to the origins and
history of the dishes rather than just to how much of it you can sell at a profit.

Replace _food_ with _code_ and _poof_ you have _slow code_.
