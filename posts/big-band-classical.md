Today I'm going to survey some CDs (and downloads, and some streaming) that I've been
listening to an enjoying. The concentration this time will be on the _symphonies_ from the
"Classical" period of Classical music: [Mozart and
Haydn](the-surprising-classical-groove.html). I've also been back in my [Mahler
hole](./two-thirds.html) a bit, but we'll get to that later.

The first thing to say about Mozart and Haydn is that everyone plays it wrong these days.
Yes I'm just a guy with no real musical training and no real basis for holding this
opinion against the collected wisdom of thousands of people who know more than me. But, I
know what sounds good when I play it in my ear holes and many of the modern schemes for
performing Mozart and Haydn (and even Beethoven and Brahms) don't interest me. They
(mostly) just sound worse and less interesting.

As always, I have [ranted about this before](./nouvelle-old-music.html). But I thought I
would repeat myself as a prelude for a piece that recommends nothing but "old fashioned"
recordings of Mozart and Haydn with full orchestras and lots of vibrato.

#### Mozart

The big players here are Bruno Walter, Sir Thomas Beecham, Karl Bohm, George Szell and
Otto Klemperer. The Beecham records are pre-stereo and a bit rough if you like the classic
big 1960s/1970s stereo sound. In that case Szell, Bohm and Klemperer are the best bets.
The Walter recordings are somewhere between. They range from OK mono to OK stereo.
