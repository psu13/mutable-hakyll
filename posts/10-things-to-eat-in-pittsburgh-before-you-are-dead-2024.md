I have not done one of these for almost ten years, and a lot has changed. So it's time.

In no particular order, stuff you should try to eat before you or it is gone. Note that a lot of
stuff from my previous lists is _actually_ gone (like the precious chili dog at the O) so
keep that in mind!

1. **Pork Xiao Long Bao: Everyday Noodle**

    Everyday Noodle is a local miracle. The place should not be able to exist and it
certainly should not be as good as it is. It's as good or better than comparable places in
cities that have what you would call "real" high level Chinese food: Vancouver BC, the Bay
Area, LA, Toronto, etc. It also competes well with comparable places _in Asia_. I don't
know what they are doing to maintain this, but I'm happy they are doing it and I'm going
to keep going as often as I can because there is no way it can last forever.

1. **"House Fly Heads": Cafe 33**

    Taiwanese Bistro Cafe 33 is run by some former Rose Tea folks, if I recall correctly.
They have generally managed to put out a Rose Tea level of quality Taiwanese food, though
the pandemic took its toll and it's a little more variable now than before. This dish
mixes the Chinese garlic chives, ground pork, and black beans. The black beans are the fly
heads. It's great. You should get it.

1. **Lomo Saltado: Chicken Latino**

    Chicken Latino is a long time Peruvian roast chicken joint that also branches out into
some standard "Mexican" menu items, though with a unique twist and also uniquely large
sizes. Lomo Saltado is Peruvian Chinese-style beef stir fry with beef, onion, peppers and
tomatoes served on top of rice with fries. You have to go get it.

1. **Tostada de At√∫n: Duos Taqueria**

    Duo's Taqueria is in the Duo Lingo building and is the brain child of one Marcella
    Ogrodnik who made the Salvadoran pupusas at the local farmer's markets before and
    during the pandemic. Anyone who has had her pupusas thinks about them every day. Duo's
    markets itself as Mexican leaning, but really everything is just Marcie food. This
    tostada is a crispy tortilla shell topped with raw tuna, salsa negra and various other
    delicious things. Get it at lunch and pair it with the chilaquiles. Incredible.

1. **Lamb Adana Plate: Emily's Mediterranean in Gibsonia**

    Emily's is a Turkish place far north of the city. I can't tell you if it's worth the
drive, but it's pretty close to where I live so it's worth it for me. The kebabs and doner
are great. The place is friendly and personable. The adana plate is spiced ground lamb
that's been grilled on a skewer and then put on a plate with rice and salad. It will make
you happy.

1. **Tteokbokki (with cheese and ramen), Wings: Nak Won Garden**

    Nak Won is a little Korean place on Centre avenue. Good homey food. All the Chinese
students from CMU go there for the shared hot pots. The Koreans have a unique take on rice
cakes, and Nak Won makes a good version of it. Also [asian food with
cheese](./cheese-ramen.html) is always a good idea. If you get this dish plus the wings,
it's a perfect thing to split with one or two other people and not get too full.

1. **Peach and Corn Pizza: Driftwood Oven**

    I have nothing more to say about this. You know where Driftwood is. Go get it.

1. **Mango Cake: Dish**

    I have written about Dish here over and over again. This is one of the three best
    things they do. Get it when they have it.

1. **Fish Filet with Green Pepper Sauce: Chengdu Gourmet**

    I think Chengdu Gourmet has now been around enough for us to call it a local
    institution. This dish is most easily obtained at the original spot ... if you order
    it at the new Chengdu Gourmet 2 it comes as a strange whole fish presentation that is
    not as good. In its original form it's frozen (I assume) white fish filets stewed in a
    broth with bean sprouts, green sichuan pepper corns and just enough green chili pepper
    to melt your face off if you are a weak American. Fantastic.

1. **Roti with yellow curry and the 17 Ingredient Salad at Pusadee's**

    For a long time Pusadee's Garden was a local favorite hole in the wall Thai place
    attached to someone's house (I assumed) in Lawrenceville. We went once or twice but
    the access was too annoying. Then a few years ago they shut down and started
    rebuilding the Lawrenceville space in a completely new building. The new spot opened
    in the tail end of the pandemic and it is _jaw droppingly_ beautiful. I have never
    personally been in a restaurant that got _everything_ about wheelchair access _exactly
    right_ on day one. But Pusadee's does it. These two starters are also two of the best
    ten dishes anywhere in the city. And everything else on the menu is generally just as
    good. All this and you can get mango and sticky rice for dessert. I should have done a
    full page on Pusadee's before now. But that's what you get for following a dilettante
    like me. 

*Honorable mentions*: 

Anything else on the menu at any of these places. 

The Chonqing style "dry hot" whole chicken wings at Sichuan Spice in Shadyside are a
sensation. This is not on their online takeout menu, so maybe I hallucinated it. But if
it's there get it.

Along the same lines, the Desi wings at All India on Craig St. are great, and the Mean Joe
Green wings at Big Shot Bob's (Both the OG store, and the unrelated second set of
franchises have this ... it's a long story) are also great.

You should go to New Kensington to Taqueria El Pastorcito for the al pastor tacos and also
their sunday breakfasts. There is also an old computer museum there.

Mola Sushi is almost as good as a Japanese 7-11. Soju has a very good katsu curry. The
Taiwanese sausage over rice at Rose Tea Express is everything that was great about the
original Rose Tea in one rice bowl. 

Food trucks: 100 mile crepe for jian bing. The Boonseek for Korean Corn dogs (but their spicy
fried chicken over rice is the actual best thing there), Sake Pase for incredible Haitian
braised pork stew, the Steer and Wheel for burgers.

Anything at Morcilla is good. But their menu changes too much to list any given thing here
and expect it to still be there when you get there.

Hot dogs at D's must be mentioned.

The burger (and everything else) at Butterjoint must be mentioned. Even though Trevett
stopped running the spot last year it has not missed a step.

The Eastern European vegan food at Apteka is actually great. This is _me_ saying this.

Finally, new Hong Kong style dessert place Mango Mango is a must try. Not quite as good as
the Mango cake. But almost.

Even though we have lost some old friends over the last few years the restaurant scene in
Pittsburgh has really started to come back with more variety and personality than I could
have imagined it having. The fact that the asian food is completely taking over Squirrel
Hill to a previously unimaginable degree helps, of course.
