Back in 1999 the dream was born. This was the year the Tivo device first shipped. These
days we use the much more sterile and generic term "DVR" to refer to things like the Tivo.
But back then it was just Tivo.

What the Tivo did was capture broadcast TV as a cleverly encoded digital video file so
that it could fit on the comparatively tiny disk that sat in the device. Then you could
watch your TV shows whenever you wanted. You could even pause the show while it was being
broadcast, because the machine would buffer maybe half an hour on each side of "live" so
that if you had to go get snacks, or pee, or whatever, you did not have to miss anything
that happened while you were gone.

Every nerd who used a Tivo or saw a Tivo being used instantly knew what they wanted: A Tivo
in their computer that let them pick whatever shows they wanted on some kind of pay as you
go basis. And, the ability to play back the resulting video files anywhere they happened
to be on whatever device they happened to be sitting in front of. And finally, a way to
not be beholden to the particular schedule the TV people wanted to dictate. Instead, the
machine would just save the file for you whenever (time) and wherever (channel) the
content happened to appear and you would have one single user interface to interact with
to watch it.

Nerds who also liked sports (a minority to be sure, but not non-existent) especially
wanted this. No more worrying about being in front of the TV when the game is on. Just
fire up your computer sometime after it has started and there it is.
