I got a new iPhone. Mostly for the camera. Because that's why you buy new phones.

New iPhone Camera says: "Easiest to use camera you have, just open it up and hit the button".

New iPhone Camera also says:

- I have three physical lenses: normal (1x), super wide (.5x), and medium telephoto (5x).

- Yet the default set of focal length buttons at the bottom of my user interface has 4
  choices: super side (.5x), normal (1x), short telephoto (2x) and medium telephoto (5x).

- Also when you hit the 1x button it toggles between up to 3 synthesized lens focal lengths:
  24mm (1x), 28mm (1.2x) and 35mm (1.5x).

- Also depending on which physical or synthesized lens you use you get a different
  effective resolution in the final file.

- With the default settings: the super wide camera gives you 12MP, the 1x camera gives you
  24MP, the short synthesized lenses (the "fusion camera") give you 24MP, the 2x camera
  gives you 12MP, and the telephoto camera gives you 12MP.

- With the MAX setting the super wide camera changes to 48MP, the 1x camera is 48MP, the
  1.2x camera is 35MP, the 1.5x camera is 24MP, the 2x camera is 12MP, and the telephoto
  camera is 12MP.
  
- With the RAW MAX setting all the resolutions are the same as above (48, 48, 35, 24, 12,
  12), but the files are 5-10x bigger.

- If you set 12MP mode in the camera app settings and are not using MAX mode then the
  default resolutions all go to 12MP instead of whatever they were before. The default for
  this setting is "24MP", but that only holds for the 1x, 1.2x and 1.5x cameras, as
  established above.

- Also I have a new second button on the side of the phone that lets you set all kinds of
  different things, all of which you can also set with the regular touch UI with more
  speed and precision (in the opinion of the writer). The most confusing of these settings
  is "depth" which looks like it is letting you set aperture, but actually it's just
  setting the fake aperture that the fake shallow depth of field effect is pretending to
  create.

  This is al we'eve been able to figure out in one morning of noodling with the camera. In
  our next episode we will discuss exactly what photo "styles" do.
