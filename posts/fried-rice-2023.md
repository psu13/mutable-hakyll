A few years ago [at "peak pandemic"](pandemic-shorts-3.html) I wrote a short blurb about
fried rice where, among other things, I praised the tireless work that [Uncle
Roger](https://www.youtube.com/c/mrnigelng/videos) had been doing to defend this staple of
East/South Asian cuisine against a seemingly never-ending onslaught of stupidity,
overthinking and general cluenessness.

Sadly, his work has not been enough. Even now in 2023 we who love this dish are still
under a constant barrage of bad fried rice recipes. So I felt I had to act. Here I will
repeat my [long standing](fried-rice.html) simple fried rice recipe, but with a few
updates to reflect the added insight about the dish that I have gained since I wrote that
down more than 15 years ago. In addition I'll provide some reference links to other places
to look for good fried rice advice. With all of this material in hand you can now safely
ignore any new suggestions for how to make fried rice coming from the mainstream food
media of the damned (New York Times, Bon Appetit, etc) and just bookmark this page
instead.
