It's hard to believe it's been ten years since I constructed this relatively random
collection of 2000 words about Wagner's Ring:

[https://mutable-states.com/how-to-ring.html](https://mutable-states.com/how-to-ring.html)

This short note is mostly here to say that I still believe most of the random words that
are on that page, but a few things have changed in the record business since it was
written.

First, they remastered the _Solti_ box _again_. It's not clear to me there was any reason
to do that, and you can't find the last re-re-re-master from 2012 anymore which is a bit
sad since it had gotten cheap.

But cheap also doesn't matter because of the other major change in records since ten years
ago: now basically everything I wrote about on that page is on the streaming services.
Actually I guess this was almost true back then too, but streaming had not yet completely
crushed all the other alternatives to the same extent as it has now. Anyway, you can pay
one small fee for all the Ring you can eat.

But, one recording you still can't find on streaming is the [Keilberth set from
Testament](https://testament.co.uk/product-category/the-keilberth-ring-cycle/?display_mode=list)
which I will also [link to on Presto
Music](https://www.prestomusic.com/classical/products/7961659--wagner-der-ring-des-nibelungen)
since I bet the other link will go bad. By the way, Presto Music is great, even if it is
weird to have to buy CDs from the UK to avoid the great Amazon world crushing machine.

I talked about this recording on my old page, and even bought the set, but did not get
around to carefully listening to it all the way through until recently. The first couple
of times I played it I got stuck in the part of Rheingold where someone turns on a wind
machine on stage and it sits there howling for 20 minutes. Later I managed to work past
that, and then to the rest of the operas after that.

My completely uninformed opinion is that this is probably the best of the "historical"
class of recordings from the 50s. This is mostly a guess since I have not really listened
to any of the others, because they all sound awful. This one is in stereo. You can really
hear how good the singers are. The sound is good enough to really capture the whole
theater experience.

Still, as good as the Keilberth is, there is still annoying stage noise, strange hissing,
people coughing, and some inexplicably weird/amateurish sounding orchestral playing in the
quiet parts (especially the brass). The _production_ is still no match for Solti and his
giant band in Vienna. The sound on the Solti records was captured under basically perfect
studio conditions and you can hear this in every second of the set. So you should still
get it. Luckily this is easy because you just sign up for Apple Music or
[Presto](https://www.prestomusic.com/streaming) or whatever and go to it. No real
hardship.

So, that's all the new things I had to say. I still like Solti, BÃ¶hm, and that
crazy [Goodall recording in English on
Chandos](https://www.prestomusic.com/classical/products/7945388--the-goodall-ring-cycle).
You can stream all of those. Then add Keilberth for history. For a really modern set try
the [Simone
Young](https://www.prestomusic.com/classical/products/8027216--wagner-der-ring-des-nibelungen).
I have liked the bits I have heard. It's next on my list to get all the way through. After
I play the Solti again.

In case you want to delve further, or don't believe me ...

1. Watch [this video overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlibyruxdk) which says the
   same thing.

2. Read [this much more extensive
   survey](http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2019/Feb/Wagner_ring_survey.pdf)
   which also says basically the same thing.

See you in ten years when they remaster the Solti _again_.
