This article contains "spoilers" for future _Ulysses_ text nerds. So beware.

Late last year I finally finished "reading" (half reading, half listening) [a giant book by
Alex Ross](https://www.therestisnoise.com/wagnerism/) from 2020 on the cultural influence of Richard Wagner from the 19th Century
until now. Mostly what I got out of that book was a feeling of "Are the artist fans of
Richard Wagner OK?" ... because boy they all seemed like neurotic oversexed sociopaths.

Anyway, somewhere in that book is a section on references to Wagner in the novels of James
Joyce in general and I guess _Ulysses_ in particular because somehow the idea got planted in
my head that I should try to read this book.

It turns out that _Ulysses_ is a _great_ book for a nerd with a low key obsession for the
study of historical variations in artistic works
([discographies](./discography-trouble.html), for example). This is because no one can
actually agree on what the right text for the novel is. And that is because Joyce himself
kept changing the book even as it was published in small pieces and multiple editions over
time.

When I found out that there was a critical edition of the novel from 1984 that is also
essentially a strangely encoded version control history of the text I was _all in_.

The "end user" version of that critical edition is the 1986 _Ulysses: The Corrected Text_
by Gabler, et. al. And this version of the book, at least in the U.S., contains my
favorite textual variation so far. The 17th episode of the novel ("Ithaca") is supposed to
end with a question "Where?" followed by a large filled in circular dot as the answer to
the question on a line by itself. Like this:

> Where?

> ⚫️

This is referred to as the "Ithaca dot" and is intermittently missing in various printed
editions of the book. Just to give you idea of the level of _Ulysses_ nerds, I found at
least one 15 page paper in an _academic journal_ about this dot. That's almost as extreme
as all those old computer science papers about [goto statements](the-ultimate-goto.html).

For more background, here is an excerpt from the most recent encyclopedia of _Ulysses_
annotations about this dot:

> <img src="images/ulysses-dot.png" width="600" alt="text about the ithaca dot" title="text about the ithaca dot">

Here the "17.2332" refers to the number of the line of text in chapter 17 where the dot
should appear in the Gabler text that I talked about above.

Except the joke is on all of us because the copy of the so-called "corrected text" that I
bought is missing this dot at this position, even though there is a short section about it
in the introduction _and_ even though the critical edition that the book is based on is
_not_ missing it. Disappoint.

I have heard that the UK printing of the Gabler "reading" text has the dot. But I'm not
quite over the edge enough to try and go get _that_ ... unless I happen to be in the UK
for some other reason in the future.

Of course these days one can find various electronic versions of the text and put the dot
in manually if it's missing. But it's not quite the same.

So, having spent the last month or three working through the book I have two short
thoughts about it.

First, even without all of the apparently infinite levels of meta-discourse about the
book, the book itself is pretty cool. It has various overwrought and difficult passages,
but I think that aspect of it is somewhat overrated, especially in the early chapters.
It's also an often hilarious book and it's worth reading at least the first half just for
the funny bits (and if you get through half you might as well finish it).

I mean, even the first sentence is a low level chuckle:

> Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned:

Second, the apparently infinite levels of meta-commentary bring the book to a higher level
of interest for me. I have told a few people that this novel is the closest that _fiction_
has ever come to being like reading the source code to a large application program. If you
want to mess around with it there are puzzles inside puzzles inside puzzles. But, you can
also just let that wash over you and ignore it and just enjoy everything at the surface
level.

To conclude: if you ever wondered about reading _Ulysses_ I recommend you try. It's easy
to find [a free version of the text](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/4300/pg4300-images.html) to start with, and then you can decide how far down the
possibly infinite pit of obsession you want to fall. It's a great ride.
