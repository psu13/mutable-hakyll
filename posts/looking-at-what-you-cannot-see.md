The James Webb Space Telescope took off into space over the weekend. In the lead up to
the launch I had read up some of the background for this device, and let me just say that
what they are trying to do with this telescope is [super ultra
bonkers](https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-nasas-james-webb-space-telescope-matters-so-much-20211203/).

The super short summary is: fold a telescope mirror that is four times the area of the
Hubble *and* a giant foil sun-shield that is even larger into a (relatively) tiny little
tube and shoot it into an orbit a million miles from the Earth where it unfolds by remote
control. The sun-shield keeps the sun off of it so it can stay cold enough to collect the
infrared light that its mirror is optimized for.

At this point my brain twitched a bit. Infrared? Why optimize a telescope for infrared?

Well. You may recall the story I told once about [telescopes and spectral
lines](the-wrong-question.html). See, it turns out that when you shine light through gas
and look at it with an instrument called a [_spectrograph_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_spectrometer) that breaks the light up into a spectrum, the spectrum
will be dotted with either dark or bright lines at very specific frequencies. Like this:

The mechanism that causes these lines to appear where they do had no explanation until the
early 20th century, and was one of the founding problems of quantum mechanics. But that's
a story for a future article.

The spectral lines of hydrogen and other atoms have taught us more than you might be able
to imagine about how the universe works. They tell
