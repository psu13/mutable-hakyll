Tonight an end of summer farmer's market banger. This is also probably the best food idea
to come to life in the house since the peanut butter and chili crisp toast, or the ma-po tofu
tater tots. 

Karen gets the credit for figuring out the right way to put the tomatoes in. Otherwise
this was all my idea. Strictly speaking I made up a version of it [in another post in
2019](https://mutable-states.com/fried-rice-updated.html), but we ended up with here was
better than that.

I give you: *BLT Fried Rice*.

1. Brown off 3 or 4oz of diced bacon. Keep a bit of the fat.
2. In the fat, scramble one egg for fried rice in a 12-13 wok or similar frying pan.
3. To the egg add 3 or 4 chopped scallion and about 1/3 or more of a head of iceberg
   lettuce roughly chopped/shredded.
4. Add 2 cups of cooked rice, salt, and black pepper. Mix around until it's fried rice.
5. Drizzle a bit of soy sauce down the side of the wok.
6. Finally add a diced tomato on top. Mine was a good medium/large red slicer, which is
   the best thing to use here. If it's good. Find the best thing you can.

Mix mix mix some more.

Put it in a bowl with a fried egg on top. Kewpie Mayo on top is also great.
