Ten things I forgot to mention in my previous page on _Elden Ring_.

1. Soul, er, blood echoes, er, whatever farming. There is a great spot where, in the grand
  FromSoft tradition, you can do pretty fast farming on dumb enemies. You have to do the
  quest of  <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/White+Mask+Varre">Varre</a> who
  you meet in the opening area of the game. It takes a bit of work, and you need to kill
  one great rune boss. But then you can get infinite levels for a while as long as you
  have a bow.

2. Just to be more explicit than I was in my long ramble: Leveling Dex, Faith, and Arcane,
   running the Uchi and some bleed stuff through the early and mid game, and then melting
   the late game with the mimic, _Rivers of Blood_, _Swarm of Flies_, and _Rotten Breath_
   is a pretty happy way to get through without too much fuss. Even Malenia is not _too_
   hard with this combo.

3. Caelid and Volcano Manor are where all the early power items are. Of course, Caelid and
   Volcano Manor are both horrible places.

4. The single worst navigational path in the game is how you get to the other part of
   the Altus Plateau (where Volcano Manor is) from the part you see first. It's like
   driving from Pittsburgh to Cleveland via Toronto.

5. I tried dual wielding the biggest swords in the game and <a
   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEhs6ZcG8Rc">it was kind of comical</a>.

6. The jumping attack talisman is sort of over-powered. But of course you have to be good
   at landing jumping attacks.

7. One of the most interesting things about this game are all of the different stacking
   buff items (talismans, armor, physicks, spells) that increase your stats, or your
   damage, or both. The different combinations are a dizzying puzzle if you are a bit too
   much into min/maxing. It's not too hard to find combos that double or triple the damage
   of specific attacks without necessarily needing to be in some low health "RTSR" mode
   like in the older games. In my magic run at Malenia the _Night Comet_ spell I used
   started at about 500-600 damage in a vanilla setup. After the buffs (and a few more
   levels for a different staff) I got it to do 1300-1500 or more. Fun stuff. 
   
   Here is the setup: 65-ish INT, Starscourge Heirloom for +5 INT, Marika's Soreseal for
   +5 INT and +5 Mind, Godfrey's Icon for +15% damage on charged attacks, Staff of the
   Lost in the off hand for +30% damage on Night Sorceries (you only have to hold the
   staff to get the buff, handy!), Magic Shrouding Cracked Tear in the Physick potion for
   +20% magic damage (this lasts 3min, so at the end of the fight it was done). I also
   used _Rennala's Full Moon_ to for the 10% magic resist debuff, but this only lasts for
   the first minute of the fight. All the buffs multiply together to get to 2-3x of my
   original base damage. Super fun.

8. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwPEYdKxhJk">crazy NPC quest with the
   talking pot</a> is funny.

9. The various stat buff items, and the Serpent Hunter spear in Volcano manor are what
   make me think I could possibly do a low level run of this game. Need to find some
   friendly spirits to use too. Maybe _Dung Eater_.

10. Speaking of which, the _Dung Eater_ quest is pretty funny/tragic too. And what weird
    armor.

Bonus #11: Have to try the bubble horns on a faith build. They look stupidly powerful.
Yes, a giant horn that shoots magic bubbles.
