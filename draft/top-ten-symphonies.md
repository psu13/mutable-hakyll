So my beloved Pittsburgh Symphony played the Prokofiev Symphony number 5 this weekend and
the results were predictably glorious. While grooving to the incredible beat drops in the
second movement (IFYKYK) my mind wondered to the question of the "best" symphonies I've
heard.

Of course if you include records then the list is way too long to edit down for a short
web page. But if you restrict it to pieces that I'm pretty sure I've heard live this
should be doable. So here we go. These are in no particular order.

### Beethoven 7

### Symphonie Fantastique

### Prokofiev 5

### Shostakovich 15

### Mahler 2

### Bruckner 9

### Sibelius 4

### Shostakovich 10

### Dvorak 8

### Brahms 3
