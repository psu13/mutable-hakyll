Computer nerds, and computer programmers especially, like to think that we are a more
enlightened population of people. We fancy ourselves a group who are practiced at observing
the problems of the world and tackling them with the combination of systematic rationalism
and unique personal creativity. To be blunt, we like to think that we are smarter than
most people. We like to think that we _know what we are doing_.

Unfortunately, the history of the computer programming, in industry, academia, and in that
mushy middle area of "free" or "open source" software is full of evidence to the contrary.
Examined with steely eyed objectivity, we at best balance on a very thin beam of
competence, always threatening to fall off into the pit of mindless cultism. For the
purposes of this discussion I will define a "cult" pretty loosely. A cult to me, in the
software context, is any sort of system or methodology that is a useful tool in some
circumstances but is presented by its most enthusiastic adherents as a much more general
purpose solution to any problem that you might have sitting in front of a computer. That
is, it's any time someone has decided to try and sell you on the idea that they have
somehow fought through the essential and exponential complexity of software to provide you
with a machine that makes the work needed to solve new problems straightforward and
linear. The various programming language cults are the most obvious examples of this, but
[I've talked about that before](/what-programming-languages-say.html).

My goal here is to provide a semi-historical outline of all the cults I've seen over the years
and a bit of context for where they came from. Do not be offended if some of your favorite
stuff is on this list. Some of my favorite stuff is on this list too. But, I think it is
interesting to catalog our bad ideas, or our good ideas that have been over-applied in bad
ways, in order to learn to be more thoughtful and skeptical the next time some new alleged
silver bullet comes our way. I also just wanted to write the list down, even though
ultimately it's an empty act. I will enjoy looking at the list in the future, if for no
other reason than I can use it to incorrectly argue that I am, in fact, smarter than
average.

So here we go.
