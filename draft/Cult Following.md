Here are two long quotes. The first one is from Richard Feynman: 

> In the South Seas there is a cargo cult of people. During the war they saw airplanes land
with lots of good materials, and they want the same thing to happen now. So they've
arranged to imitate things like runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to
make a wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head like headphones
and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas—he's the controller—and they wait for the
airplanes to land. They're doing everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly
the way it looked before. But it doesn't work. No airplanes land. So I call these things
cargo cult science, because they follow all the apparent precepts and forms of scientific
investigation, but they're missing something essential, because the planes don't land.

The second one is a favorite of mine, from Fred Brooks:

> The complexity of software is an essential property, not an accidental one. Hence,
descriptions of a software entity that abstract away its complexity often abstract away
its essence. For three centuries, mathematics and the physical sciences made great strides
by constructing simplified models of complex phenomena, deriving properties from the
models, and verifying those properties by experiment. This paradigm worked because the
complexities ignored in the models were not the essential properties of the phenomena. It
does not work when the complexities are the essence.
