If you spend any time reading about quantum mechanics you will inevitably come across a
dozen or two books that start with a sentence that reads like this:

> Quantum mechanics is arguably the most successful physical theory in the history of
science but strangely, no one really seems to agree about how it works.

Even Feynman opens his discussion of ["Quantum
Behavior"](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_01.html) with text like this:

> In reality, it contains the only mystery. We cannot make the mystery go away by
> “explaining” how it works.

He then goes into an explanation of the famous double-slit experiment with electrons,
which certainly illustrates many of the strange behaviors of quantum objects

I set out here to write a short page about the *measurement problem* in quantum mechanics.
It seemed like an easy task. First you list the standard axioms of the theory: Hilbert
spaces, linear algebra, the Schrödinger equation, the Born rule, entanglement, all that.
Then you describe a few examples of experiments that motivate and justify the formalism:
the double-slit, Stern-Gerlag and electron spin, photon polarization and entanglement, and
so on. Then you point out the puzzling fact that the observed behavior of "measurements"
in these experiments does not match up with how we have defined the dynamical laws of the
quantum theory. That is:

1. Quantum time evolution is deterministic and linear (via the Schrödinger, remember?)

2. Measurements appear to be stochastic, and non-linear (the "collapse" of the wave
   function).

And this is the central puzzle. Done and done.

I tried to do this, and it didn't work. The mathematical, historical and narrative
background kept ballooning out of the control, until I felt like I'd need to write a whole
book to explain this one problem. And I am not qualified to write a whole book.

So when in doubt, take the direct approach, which I have done above. Then explain your
words after saying them out loud, which I will now do. Let's see if it works this time.
