If you spend any time reading about quantum mechanics you will inevitably come across a
dozen or two books that start with a sentence that reads like this:

> Quantum mechanics is arguably the most successful physical theory in the history of
science but strangely, no one really seems to agree about how it works.

Even Feynman opens his discussion of ["Quantum
Behavior"](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_01.html) with text like this:

> In reality, it contains the only mystery. We cannot make the mystery go away by
> “explaining” how it works.

He then goes into an explanation of the famous double-slit experiment with electrons,
which certainly does seem puzzling.

On the other hand, if you ask noted computer scientist and quantum computing guy [Scott
Aaronson](https://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/) to explain quantum mechanics what he
says seems much more confident and straightforward:

> Quantum mechanics is a beautiful generalization of the laws of probability: a
> generalization based on the 2-norm rather than the 1-norm, and on complex numbers rather
> than nonnegative real numbers.

I think both of these statements are true. On the one hand, in the 50 years since Feynman
wrote his lectures we have come to a greater understanding about the structure of quantum
mechanics and what the theory tells us about the world. On the other hand, there are still
a few chewy mysteries at the center of it all. To spoil where I am going, even Mr.
Aaronson says this, after declaring above that quantum mechanics itself is in some sense
completely obvious:

> Well, the thing I didn’t tell you is that there’s a separate rule for what happens when
> you make a measurement: a rule that’s “tacked on” (so to speak), external to the
> equations themselves. That rule says, essentially, that the act of looking at a particle
> forces it to make up its mind about where it wants to be, and that the particle makes
> its choice probabilistically.

But, I'm getting ahead of myself. Before we can tackle this issue of measurement we need a
bit more background about what quantum mechanics says and how and why it's set up the way
it is.
