I set out here to write a short page about the *measurement problem* in quantum mechanics.
It seems like an easy task. First you list the standard axioms of the theory: Hilbert
spaces, linear algebra, the Schrödinger equation, the Born rule, entanglement, all that.
Then you describe a few examples of experiments that motivate and justify the formalism:
the double-slit, Stern-Gerlag and electron spin, photon polarization and entanglement, and
so on. Then you point out the puzzling fact that the observed *behavior* of "measurements"
in these experiments does not match up with how we have defined the dynamical laws of the
quantum theory. That is:

1. Quantum time evolution is deterministic and linear (via the Schrödinger, remember?)

2. Measurements appear to be stochastic, and non-linear (the "collapse" of the wave
   function).

And this is the central puzzle. Done and done.

I tried to do this, and it didn't work. The mathematical, historical and narrative
background kept ballooning out of the control, until I felt like I'd need to write a whole
book to explain this one problem. And I am not qualified to write a whole book.

So when in doubt, take the direct approach, which I have done above. Then explain your
words after saying them out loud, which I will now do. Let's see if it works this time.
