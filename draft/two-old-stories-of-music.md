One of the things that is allegedly dead in the stark new musical landscape of faceless
server in the sky streaming (almost) all the music ever recorded by man directly to the
Internet connected device in your pocket and then to your earholes is the idea of
spontaneous and serendipitous discovery.

The notion is that when we used to have to interact with the world in order to obtain
recorded music we would often be confronted with random and strange items that we would
not have otherwise sought out on our own, thus expanding our horizons in useful and
educational ways.

While I love and miss the act of browsing in a record store as much as the next record
nerd I do want to offer these two stories as words of possible encouragement that maybe
the art of the random discovery, unmediated by the whims of the automatic and algorithmic
machines that play music for us now, is not yet completely dead.

so many months ago at the beginning of this year, when we were all feeling care free and full of youthful energy, i went to see a saxophone trio in Pittsburgh and they played an encore that i knew i had heard but could not place off the top of my head.

being an idiot engineer, instead of asking someone, i played every random monkish bop tune i had in my itunes and finally figured out that it was this

but wait. what's that riff they play in the recap after the bridge? that's not the original tune!
that is clearly some OTHER generic Monk-ish or Charlie Parker riff
for weeks i tried to find it and could not. i even posted on an internet forum and got no answer
then tonight i was reading some category theory tutorial and absent mindedly listening to an Art Pepper record that i have ... and I hear this.
